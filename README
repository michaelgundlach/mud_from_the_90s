I wrote this MUD around 1997 as a present for my brother.  Today's Pascal compilers on Windows 7
don't behave the same as the Turbo Pascal compiler I used on DOS or Win95, so the code doesn't
completely work yet.  Two problems:

1. ITEMS.DAT was corrupted at some point -- if I can get the rest of the code working, I could
rebuild this manually from the strings still legible in the corrupted file

2. The compiler doesn't allow me to open a file that's already open.  IOResult is 5, Access Denied.
The old code reopens the file willy nilly to find items.  I could hack it by making a bunch of copies
of the files, but that wouldn't easily allow rewriting of the rooms.dat file which
I *think* the code does when you pick up items?  Or I could rewrite the funcs that reopen a file
to instead take the open file as a param, save our current position, do the work, and restore the
current position.
